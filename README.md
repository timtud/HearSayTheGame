## Gameplay

Each round is made up of 10 tweets. The player is presented with a tweet and four multiple choice answers. They must then choose which celebrity they think wrote the tweet. Then the correct answer is shown and they can move on to the next tweet. Tweets are generated from a database of nearly 500 tweets. After each question, the player has the option to follow the celebrity on twitter.

## Scoring

Each tweet is initially worth 100 points, however this diminishes over time. If players respond faster, they are rewarded with more points. After each round, players can share their score on Facebook or Twitter and check how their score ranks on the leaderboards if they are signed in. Each round adds points to a player's cumulative fame score.

## User Profile

Players can log in using their email, Facebook, or Twitter. Once signed in, a profile is automatically generated for them. Each player's previous games are displayed in their profile. Players can also search for their friends and use the follow feature to connect with them.

## Achievements
